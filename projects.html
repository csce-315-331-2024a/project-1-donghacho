    <h1>SAE/GM Autodrive Challenge</h1>
    <p>
      In this project, I, along with other engineering students, worked collaboratively to transform a Chevrolet Bolt into a Level 4 Autonomous Vehicle. As a member of the vision+lidar processing sub-team, I enhanced the vehicle's perception capabilities by training the YOLO v8 algorithm on custom datasets with over 4000 traffic light images, achieving accurate identification of different traffic light states.

    <h1>Interactive 3D Robot Simulation</h1>
    <p>
      I created a 3D robot model with 10 connected parts, using a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm for rendering. The project allowed for user interaction, enabling control and movement of the robot parts through keyboard commands. Furthermore, I added animations to depict the robot in motion and used C++ along with OpenGL for improved graphics, showcasing my skills in programming and visual design.

    <h1>Chrome Dino Game Remake</h1>
    <p>
      I remade the iconic Chrome Dino Game, introducing a feature that allows the T-Rex to shoot fireballs, thereby adding a strategic element to the gameplay. Using C++ and SFML, I applied object-oriented programming principles to develop the game mechanics and features.
