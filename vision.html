  <div class="myvision">
    <p>
      As a computer science student aspiring to be a software developer specializing in computer graphics and computer vision, I aim to leverage my skills to contribute meaningfully to my community. I want to serve my community by developing innovative and accessible technology solutions that address real-world challenges and improve people's everyday lives. 
      <br>
      <br>
      To achieve this goal, I plan to create applications that educate and entertain users. For instance, an educational app integrating AR/VR and computer vision technologies can provide interactive and personalized learning experiences. This app, tailoring content to fit individual needs and preferences, can make learning more accessible, especially for younger children and those with disabilities.
      <br>
      <br>
      In addition, I plan on using my computer graphics skills to develop visualizations and simulations that can help solve problems within my community. Developing these visual tools can be particularly beneficial in environment protection or disaster preparation, helping to visualize the impact of potential decisions or predict the outcome of various events.
      <br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, I am passionate about creating open-source projects that can serve as a platform for collaboration and innovation in software development. Building a community of developers with different backgrounds and specialties makes it possible to tackle societal issues, such as improving healthcare systems and enhancing public safety.
      <br>
      <br>
      However, working with powerful technologies, I must stay ethical in their use. Therefore, it is also an integral part of my job to advocate for and adhere to ethical standards in software development, ensuring that the products I contribute to are innovative yet safe and respectful of people's privacy.
      <br>
      <br>
      To conclude, my future in computer science goes beyond mastering coding languages and tools and making good money. It is about utilizing my knowledge to build socially responsible and beneficial solutions. I am still a college student with a lot to learn, but I plan to give back in the future by creating products that positively contribute to my community and make a lasting impact.
