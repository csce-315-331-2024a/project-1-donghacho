  <div class="myvision">
    <p>
      Studying computer science for me is about more than just getting through the challenging courses. It's about pursuing what I'm genuinely passionate about: software development, computer graphics, and computer vision. These aren't merely subjects to me. They are gateways to create cool products that don't just exist but bring joy to people's everyday lives.  
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm all about pushing boundaries and creating something groundbreaking. Why make something that already exists? Why stick to the ordinary? I aim to develop games that aren't just a fleeting pastime but rather lead you on an endless adventure. Similarly, I envision social media apps that aren't mere clones of others but platforms that truly enable users to express themselves and discover new worlds and cultures. It's not just about coding. It's about unleashing creativity and breathing life into innovative ideas. Each line of code is a step towards building an experience that's exciting, eye-opening, and full of surprises.
      <br>
      <br>
      This passion for innovation extends beyond just the creative aspect. I am equally committed to ensuring that these cutting-edge products are also super user-friendly and enjoyable. After all, what's the point if people can't easily engage with what you’ve created? College has been this awesome playground where I get to experiment, collaborate on cool projects, and even learn from my mistakes. Each coding assignment, hackathon, or side project is like a new adventure, enriching my understanding of user experience and refining my ability to craft user-centered products.
      <br>
      <br>
      Looking ahead, I’m excited about the endless possibilities. With every new technology or concept I learn, the range of what I can create keeps expanding. Here at Texas A&M, I'm learning a lot, working on exciting projects, and preparing to start my professional career. I'm genuinely excited about creating something that not only innovates but also inspires, unites, and brings a smile to someone's face. That's the dream, my way of giving back to the community, and little by little, it’s becoming more and more real.
